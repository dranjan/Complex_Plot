This is an attempt to develop reusable tools for rendering planar "color
maps" (functions that assign to each point on the plane a color)
generally and those related to transformations of the complex plane
(including some popular fractals) specifically. 

Minimum requirements:
- g++
- SDL
- SCons

See the file SConstruct to see which programs can be built. 

Most of the programs support zooming (mouse middle-click), but not all
(in particular, mandel_ext). This is unfortunately rather slow.

To run mandel_ext, after the first picture is drawn, press "f" (with the
SDL window active). This will make a plot showing the external angle as
hue.
